# Buzzthrough
This is a educational website which I have made by taking the reference from geeksforgeeks.In this project I have showed my creativity skills with the basic level security to protect the user from the unauthorised access. 
the languages used in the frontend are basic one such as html5,Css,Js.I have not used any kind of framework just tried to keep it very simple and easy to understand.
For the database connectivity i have used the php language to connect the database with the server and for the database I have used mysql.
